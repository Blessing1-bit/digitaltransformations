Endra McVernan Global Services, a key player in the medical services industry that specializes in the production and supply of hospital equipment. Since its founding in 2005, the company has grown steadily, now employing over 800 people across several locations in Western Canada. Despite its success, the company has relied on the same operational software for over 15 years.

- **Lack of Mobile Access**: The on-site support field technicians are not able to access customer's critical information for effective installation.
- **High Maintenance Cost**: The asset sustenance department spends a significant amount maintaining the outdated system resulting in frequent crashes.
