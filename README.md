<h2>1.Introduction</h2>

Endra McVernan Global Services, a key player in the medical services industry that specializes in the production and supply of hospital equipment. Since its founding in 2005, the company has grown steadily, now employing over 800 people across several locations in Western Canada. Despite its success, the company has relied on the same operational software for over 15 years. As this legacy system reaches the end of its useful life, the company is faced with severe challenges that has negatively impacted its business operations.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2> 

- Limited functionalities: The customer service team is unable to effectively manage customer's orders,

- Lack of Mobile Access: The on-site support field technicians are not able to access customer's critical information for effective installation.
- High Maintenance Cost: The asset sustenance department spends a significant amount maintaining the outdated system resulting in frequent crashes.

<h2>Business Impact</h2>

- 30% increase in order processing times
- b13% decline in sales number

<h2>2.3 Process Flow Diagrams and Swim Lanes</h2>
Performed an analysis of the existing manual reservation process, identifying pain points and areas for improvement, 
then utilized BPMN Tools such as MS Visio to create Process Maps
to illustrate the current (AS-IS) and future (TO-BE) business processes.
